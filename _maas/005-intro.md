Mobility as a Service (MaaS) will contribute to a more sustainable transport system. Using MaaS, travellers can purchase suitable mobility packages that combine different transport services from a single interface and using a single payment. The intention is that the use of MaaS mobility packages can replace the need for car ownership. 

MaaS requires digital integration with various transport service providers, such as public transport, bike and scooter rental, car sharing, taxi and car rental. Performing such integration is a complex and resource-demanding effort and more research on good practices and supporting technologies is required. In general, there is a need to investigate how MaaS can be established, organised and operated efficiently. 

This website will provide information about MaaS based on the research performed in ReiseNavet. The website will be updated as new results from literature reviews, interviews, development activities and other sources are obtained.
