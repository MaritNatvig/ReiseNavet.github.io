MaaS requires the integration of data from a multitude of sources. Different data formats and  data exchange standards are in use, contributing to syntactic and semantic heterogeneity which makes integration tasks complex and resource-demanding. 

ReiseNavet develops tools based on semantic technology to support data integration in a MaaS setting. A MaaS ontology is developed to ensure a standardised vocabulary that will be used to mediate between proprietary data formats and the ReiseNavet Platform. The [MaaS ontology](https://github.com/ReiseNavet/MaaSOntology) is based on Transmodel and its extension for new transport modes (CEN TS17413). 

In collaboration with a group of students from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) ReiseNavet has developed a prototype [data integration tool](http://dataintegrasjon.reisenavet.no/) that automatically identifies mappings between different data formats.
